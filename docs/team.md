## Software Steering Council Representative

Each *official* subproject in Jupyter gets a single [Software Steering Council
Representative](https://jupyter.org/governance/software_steering_council.html#software-steering-council).
JupyterLab's representative is elected by the members. This representative
*should* be re-elected every year (in January).

In 2023, the current representative is Paul Ivanov.
