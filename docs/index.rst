Why have a Team Compass?
========================

This repository helps the Jupyter Foundations and Standards team set a weekly
course for project activity. Our overriding goal is continuous team and
project improvement.

As projects and their growth evolve rapidly, the contents of this repo
should aid us in setting project direction and adjusting the course as
needed. The repo contains:

- team meeting agendas and archives
- direction and action plans
- communication and culture of respectful teamwork
- recognitions and team celebrations

We sail together
================

While we value each others individual strengths and contributions, we succeed
or fail as a team. Whether taking corrective actions for a bug or being
recognized for good work, the team, instead of an individual, shoulders
the burden and success.

Code of Conduct
===============

The Jupyter Foundations and Standards community follows the broader
`Jupyter Community's Code of Conduct <https://jupyter.org/governance/conduct/code_of_conduct.html>`_.
